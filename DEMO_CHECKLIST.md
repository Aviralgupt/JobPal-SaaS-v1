## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Practice the demo flow** at least 3 times before presenting
2. **Have a backup plan** if something goes wrong
3. **Keep it simple** - focus on the value, not the technical complexity
4. **Engage the audience** - ask if they have specific job descriptions to try
5. **Time management** - stick to 5-7 minutes for the core demo

**Remember: The goal is to show how AI can solve real problems, not to showcase every technical detail!**
